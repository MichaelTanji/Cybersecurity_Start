# UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE. NOW.

*Software updates reduce risk. Every time you update your operating system or software, you’re making it harder for the bad guys. It may be inconvenient at times, but it is literally the easiest thing you can do to improve your security posture. When asked to update your software, do it as soon as you possibly can. Every day you put it off is another day you leave yourself, and your firm, open to exploitation.*

We’ve all done it: when prompted to update our PC operating system, or to update the software we use on our computers, we hit the “remind me later” button. We’re in the middle of something. We don’t have time to wait while the software updates, the PC reboots, etc. I totally get it.

Don’t do it.

At a minimum, make sure you add “update software” to your to-do list for the day. Make it the last thing you do before you go home for the day (you’re going to shut the computer down anyway). Establish a policy that says one has X number of hours to update their software once they receive notice. Just make sure it gets done. 

Why? 

The engineers at Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, or wherever your software was written, worked hard to put together that package of updated code. They’re giving you something that’s good for you. All you have to do is push a button and only good things will happen.  Timely updates reduce risk. You’re removing some sort of vulnerability that bad guys could exploit to your detriment. You’ve locked a door. You’ve closed a window. You’ve put up a wall. All you had to do was push a button. 

**Don’t be one of those people who won’t take ten minutes to save themselves a hundred hours. The few minutes it takes to update your software pales in comparison to the countless hours of extra work, in addition to untold dollars of what would otherwise have been profit being spent on security consulting fees, fines, and penalties that may result if that vulnerability you didn’t patch got exploited. If it’s not convenient to update your software right now, schedule it for a time when it is; just do it. Make sure everyone else knows that’s what they’re supposed to do too.**
