# ENCRYPT YOUR COMPUTERS

*Encrypting your computer hard drives helps reduce the likelihood that someone who manages to make off with a computer will also make off with the data therein. Full disk encryption, done properly, turns your stolen computer into a fancy brick. It costs nothing to implement and goes a long way in protecting what’s of value to you from both a data and resource perspective.*

Every PC or laptop sold in the last decade or so has a built-in encryption mechanism in the operating system that will encrypt the entire hard drive. Windows, Macs, it doesn’t matter. If it’s a Windows computer, the solution is called BitLocker; if it’s a Mac, it’s called FileVault. They’re both Full Disk Encryption (FDE) tools. Activate FDE on every system you can. Links on how to do so, and what to do if you can’t use BitLocker or FileVault, are in the Resources section at the end of this chapter.

Why encrypt your computer hard drives? A stolen computer is a wealth of information about you and your business. Think about what data gets processed in your office every day. Think about all that information in the hands of your competitors (local or foreign). Think about all the data someone can learn about you by seeing what web sites you’re logged into, or information about corporate infrastructure that could be used to facilitate a more extensive hack. Forget industrial espionage: think about all that data on the Internet for anyone to read. Encrypting your computers means that if they’re stolen, they’re not computers, they’re fancy, expensive bricks. The data on the computer is inaccessible to the person who stole it.  

*"How inaccessible?"*

## Resources

### Windows

If you’re using Windows 10, the Microsoft support page on [how to implement BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-device-encryption-overview-windows-10) is a great resource: 

If you’re running [Windows 7 or other versions of Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/ee449438(v=ws.10)).

Note: Not all Windows software implements full disk encryption natively. See the third-party options below for more detail.

### Mac

Apple OS X users can implement FDE with [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837).
