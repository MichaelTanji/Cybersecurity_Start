“The cloud” has alternately been described as the solution to a litany of computer scalability and expense problems, or more light-heartedly as “someone else’s computer.” Regardless of how you view the cloud, there are a couple of things to keep in mind that have an impact on cyber security.

The first is that you know where your data is (for all practical purposes). If you’re running your applications in, and storing your data in the cloud, there should be no local system to hack. I say “for all practical purposes” because in a cloud scenario your data may be spread across several computers in several different geographic locations, but that is your service provider’s responsibility and something that is transparent to you.

The other is that you have a very powerful ally when it comes to security. It is in a cloud service provider’s best interest to run secure systems, in addition to very reliable ones. Their whole business falls apart if they’re not providing a superior offering to what you can assemble on your own.
