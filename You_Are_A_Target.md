# YES, YOUR COMPANY IS A TARGET

*No company is too small or unimportant to be attacked. Your perception that the size or nature of your business makes you an unattractive target is just that: your perception, not how the bad guys think. Today anyone with any computing resources is at risk because modern attacks make even individual PCs valuable to a criminal. The fact that you don’t deal with money or billion-dollar trade secrets arguably makes you a better target because you’re not paying attention to the risk like banks and Fortune 500 companies are.*

There was a time when the nature of your business is what made you a target for cyber criminals. Banks, credit card companies, and so on were where the bad guys went because, to coin a phrase, that’s where the money was. 

Later, individuals were targeted because the bad guys figured out how to fool people into either giving up the details of their bank accounts or personal information, or tricking them into giving them access to their computers, where the bad guys would find financial and personal details to exploit. Those threats still exist today, but the mere fact that you have computing resources of any type means you’re a target. Why? Two primary reasons: cryptocurrency and ransomware.  

## Ransomware

Ransomware is a mash-up of “ransom” and “malware” (malware being an umbrella term for viruses, worms, etc.).  Ransomware campaigns are successful to the tune of several hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and it has been around in one form or another for almost 30 years. A ransomware attack is very simple: someone infects your computers, encrypts the data on them, and demands that you pay them in order to get the key that will unlock your data.  

*“We don’t negotiate with terrorists … or kidnappers … or datanappers … whatever!”*

A lot of people advocate for that sort of response. They’re usually people who’ve never been infected with ransomware, and the viability of their company is usually not hanging in the balance.  If you don’t have current backups of your company data, you really don’t have a choice but to pay the ransom. You could engage a cybersecurity company to help you, but the cost of such services is almost certainly going to exceed the price of the ransom, and there is no guarantee that they will be successful. 

*“But what if I pay the ransom and they don’t send me the key to unlock my files?”*

That’s certainly a risk, and it happens sometimes, but in most cases the people behind ransomware attacks give up the key once they’re paid. In fact, the biggest, most “reputable” ransomware practitioners have set up online help forums you can use to work out any problems you might have in paying the ransom or decrypting your files. Why? For the same reason they deliver when paid: it’s good business. If you think about it, in order for ransomware to work at scale, victims have to know that they’ll get what they pay for. They have to be able to conduct transactions quickly and easily. If word gets around that you’ll get stiffed if you pay, no one will pay. Why shortchange a few hundred people and make $50,000, when you can be a nice guy to a few thousand people and make $5,000,000?
