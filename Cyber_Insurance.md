# WHAT ABOUT CYBER INSURANCE?

*You can’t mount a perfect defense against every threat or prepare for every contingency, which is why we have the insurance industry. But does cyber insurance make sense for your business? The answer depends in part on the fine print and your willingness to trust an industry that is way better at math that you are.*

About 10 years ago, cybersecurity insurance used to be a thing. Insurers lost a lot of money and stopped writing policies. About four or five years ago it started to gain popularity again, in large part because insurers decided that they were leaving too much money on the table. Their solution to the problems that plagued them last time around? Well, it wasn’t to do more due diligence.

Insurance is a completely legitimate and reasonable way to address risk, but cyber or breach insurance isn’t necessarily the solution you might think it would be. When I try to explain the problem with cyber insurance, I like to use the example of what happens when you buy supplemental life insurance. If you offer life insurance through your company, a 2x or 3x multiplier on the employee’s annual salary is probably what comes with the basic package. Employees can opt to pay for more insurance, but they have to go through the insurance company’s underwriting process. That means telling the insurance company how tall they are, how much they weigh, if they smoke or drink, etc., at which point the insurance company gives them a quote. 

Then they send a nurse to your house.

The nurse actually measures your height. She weighs you. She takes your blood pressure, draws blood, and has you lie down on the sofa for an EKG. All the while she’s looking around (discreetly) to make sure there aren’t ashtrays full of unfiltered Camel butts lying around next to empty bottles of Jack Daniels. She checks your walls and tabletops for pictures of you skydiving and putting your head inside the mouths of alligators. Basically, are you telling the truth, making you a good risk, or are you lying and a bad risk? If you’re fatter than you said, and it’s clear you’re not living a healthy lifestyle, your new quote is going to be a lot higher than the original one, to account for the fact that you’re probably going keel over sooner than expected and they’re going to have to write a check to your widow(er). Insurance companies didn’t get as big as they are by writing a lot of checks.

The problem with cyber insurance is that nobody sends a (metaphorical) nurse to your company. You will undoubtedly get a questionnaire that asks if you have an inventory of your IT assets, if you’re running anti-virus software on those assets, and other questions about how well or poorly defended you are; but no one is going to check that. If they do, it will be fairly cursory. In other words: they will not do as good a job as a hacker would if they were eyeing you as a target. 

It gets better.
