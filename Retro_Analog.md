# GO RETRO, GO ANALOG

*Not everything has to be computerized. Not everything has to be connected to the Internet. A slight increase in friction, without an inordinate increase in time required to get things done, can reduce the chances that someone will use the efficiency in your systems and/or the trust in your people, against you.*

There is a tendency in technology circles to think that if one thing can benefit from being computerized or automated, computerizing or automating all things is even better. That’s the whole reason why we have the “Internet of Things,” because a refrigerator is great, but a Wi-Fi-enabled fridge with an LCD display that allows you to stream your favorite cooking shows, and texts you when you’re low on milk is even better, right?  Technology is great, but there are cases where being a little old-fashioned can be beneficial.

Let’s consider the phenomenon of “CEO Fraud” or "Business Email Compromise". That’s someone pretending to be the boss to trick an employee who handles wire transfers or Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments to send money to an unauthorized person. Imagine Charlie, your accountant, got an email like this:

> Date: 04/01/2018
> From: Boss Lady <boss.lady@yourcompany.com>
> To: Charlie Hodge <charlie.hodge@yourcompany.com>
> Subject: For Action – wire funds
>
> Charlie,
>
> Need $10,000 earnest money wired to the account below to help close a deal. Please try to get this out before COB today.
>
> Boss

What is Charlie likely to do? If your answer is “wire the money,” then guess what? You just became a victim of CEO fraud. The boss didn’t send that email, a cyber-criminal did. She figured out how to spoof the boss’s email (or maybe took control of her actual email account) and exploited the fact that Charlie is going to do as he’s told by his boss, as long as things don’t seem too out of whack. If she had asked for $1,000,000, Charlie would probably raise an eyebrow, but $10,000? That number isn’t out of line given the size of the company and the amounts of money that are normally moved around (remember: hackers do their homework), so he doesn’t think twice. 

CEO fraud works to the tune of millions of dollars a year.  Why? Because people defer to authority. The boss is supposed to be obeyed. Do this, do that, wire money to this account. You do what the boss says, and if you have qualms about it, you keep it to yourself because you trust that the boss knows what they’re doing (that’s why they’re the boss, right?).
