# FUNDAMENTALS

*To understand any topic, you have to start at the beginning. That means covering the fundamentals. Too many efforts to fix cybersecurity problems are focused on symptoms, not root causes, which is a great way to go broke while chasing your tail. Understanding the essence of these issues will help you understand why specific recommendations are being made over others, and can help you assess your options when faced with a seemingly endless series of choices presented by legions of indistinguishable vendors and cybersecurity celebrities.*

There are a lot of cybersecurity principles and concepts, and plenty of people have written books and papers that address them in excruciating detail. We’re not going to do that here. For one thing, you don’t have the time. For another, you’re not in the security business, you’re just in business. You don’t need to be an expert; you need to be conversant. What follows are some core concepts you need to be familiar with in order to understand what it is we’re trying to do, and why certain recommendations are being made. 

**Cybersecurity is not absolute.** There is no end state where, after a lot of hard work and expense, your enterprise is completely secure. Nothing is hacker proof. Nothing guarantees 100 percent success in combatting threats. Nothing reduces risk to zero.  Anyone who says they can achieve perfection in cybersecurity—eliminating all risk, removing all threats—is lying. Some solutions get close, but they usually require trade-offs that you are likely to find unacceptable (too expensive, too cumbersome). The goal you should set for yourself is secure enough based on how you do business, what your threat model is, and what it is you’re trying to protect (more on all this later).

**Know what you’re protecting.** You cannot mount an effective defense if you don’t know what it is you’re trying to keep safe. “The company,” yes, but what does that mean? Do you know how many computers you really have? Do you know where all your data is? We’ll get into this more in-depth later, but for the time being just understand that without a comprehensive understanding of what it is you’re trying to protect, you are likely to waste a lot of time, money, and effort building something you don’t need.
