# HAVE A BACKUP PLAN

*Despite your best efforts, something bad is going to happen.  Something will come up that you cannot handle. You want to be able to pick up the phone and reach a trusted source who knows your business and your enterprise, someone who can help right out of the gate. You do not want to be scrambling around googling for someone to help you and chance ending up with someone who knows you’re in a pickle and will use that knowledge to their financial advantage.*

If you’re of a certain age, you remember weekend mornings when your father would check the oil in the family car and change it if necessary. He’d also top off the fluid in the radiator, and add water to the battery. Check the pressure on the tires and rotate them. Make sure the various belts and hoses weren’t too worn and replacing them if they were. Replacing and gapping spark plugs. These are things you don’t see done much today in the average suburban driveway. In part, that’s because the quality of automobiles and their components is so much better than it was 40, 30, or even 20 years ago. But also, thanks to businesses like Jiffy Lube, it’s faster and more convenient to have someone else do all that for you.

Today about the only “work” people do on their cars is put gas in them. Unless you buy a lemon or drive like you’re in a demolition derby, auto maintenance is actually a pretty rare occurrence when you think about it. The flip side of that coin? A lot of people have no idea what to do if their car doesn’t start, or if it starts to shake, or smoke. They can’t troubleshoot problems, much less fix them. All they know is a light on the dash came on, and then the car wouldn’t work, so they called AAA and a man in overalls made the problem go away.

Because you are not an expert in cybersecurity, and you don’t know what to do if something bad happens, you need your own cybersecurity AAA—a firm you can call to help you when you get attacked. In cybersecurity circles, what you’re looking for is a DFIR company. DFIR stands for “digital forensics and incident response,” and those are the skills you need to clean up the mess you’re in and get back to work.
