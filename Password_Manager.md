# USE A PASSWORD MANAGER

*Weak passwords and poor password practices are one of the easiest ways to facilitate getting hacked. When it comes to passwords, most people take the path of least resistance, which becomes the path to a breach. Password managers make it easy to make and manage passwords that are harder to crack, and facilitate the use of unique passwords for every account, which makes for more secure accounts, and fewer opportunities to compromise your security.*

Even cybersecurity gurus know what a pain in the butt passwords are. You’ve got however many passwords you need to remember at work, plus all your personal accounts. What do most people do? They reuse a lot of the same password(s) at work and at home. On top of that, they don’t use very good passwords. How do we know this? Sometimes, when hackers break into a system, information related to the break-in is published online.  What are some of the more common passwords used by people based on these revelations? 

- 123456		
- 123456789
- qwerty
- 12345678
- 1234567890	
- 1234567
- Password	
- letmein
- football

Now, if your local bank was robbed, and it got out that the combination to the vault was zero-zero-zero, you’d have a fit. For some reason, however, people seem to think that locking a computer—the thing that is tied to their livelihood, or that stores sensitive personal information—with something as pathetically easy to guess as 123456 is totally okay.

At this point, I want to introduce you to my friend, Stanley. Stanley runs a boutique cybersecurity consultancy that specializes in what’s known as penetration testing. Basically, their job is to break into a company’s computer systems—with permission—to point out flaws in their defenses. Stanley and his team have worked for customers all around the world, and they are exceedingly good at what they do. Based on their experiences, they have discovered the following patterns surrounding the issue of passwords:

*We can brute force  passwords of user accounts if it comes down to that, but in the last few years we’ve had the most success using one of two methods. The first is using some of the most common – and stupid – passwords like ‘12345678’ or ‘qwerty’. The second is taking a client’s employees’ names and email addresses, and comparing those names and addresses against those exposed in past data breaches, and using the passwords exposed in those breaches on their accounts. If it’s a company of any size we’ll usually find a few dozen name matches, not all of which will actually be employees (there are a lot of John Smiths out there), but there will be enough that we’ll have a solid handful of user ID and password combination pairs. It has been a long time since at least one of those combinations hasn’t worked in one of our engagements.*

### Password Managers

Which password manger to use? Here are four that have great reputations, in no particular order:

- [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)  (free)
- [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) (free and paid versions)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)  (paid)
- [Roboform](https://www.roboform.com/)  (paid)

### Have I Been Pwned?

Visit the [Have I Been Pwnd?](https://haveibeenpwned.com) website and enter your email addresses (work and home). It doesn’t contain ID/password combinations from every data breach ever, but it has a lot of them. If you haven’t already changed the passwords linked to any compromised accounts, make sure you do so now. The site also allows you to receive notifications if your address (or addresses linked to your company domain) if they’re discovered in a future breach.
