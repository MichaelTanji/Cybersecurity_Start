# BUILD SECURITY INTO YOUR CULTURE

*Like anything else in life, a successful cybersecurity effort requires you to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. People take cues from their leader’s actions, not just their words. Saying you care about security and then not taking concrete action is a waste of time and resources, and it will give you a false sense of security. As counter-intuitive as this sounds, cybersecurity needs to be a part of your everyday routine, not something special.*

Cybersecurity people often say “we need to bake-in security.” What they mean is they want software companies and hardware manufacturers to design and build things securely from the get-go and not count on third parties, like antivirus companies or firewall companies, to bolt on security capabilities after-the-fact. That after-the-fact model is how things have been done from the start of the computer age because the people who want and need computers demand functionality, not security. They want fast computers. They want computers with a lot of memory. They want computers that can handle a wide range of tasks because people are in business, they’re not in the security business. 

In the immortal words of management guru Peter Drucker: “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” The first step in any new endeavor is usually developing a strategy, which is great, but a strategy is about doing a thing; culture is about believing in a thing. Building security into your company culture isn’t just about developing and integrating security policies and practices, it is about instilling a security mindset in your people. You must make them aware of the threats, as well as the risks associated with inattentiveness and carelessness, and you must train them to make good decisions when faced with a security dilemma. Like making high quality widgets, it should become second nature.

## It Starts at The Top

People take their cues from the top. If what the boss says and what the boss does are two different things, employees will follow what the boss does.  This is true regardless of the issue at hand.

Consider our widget factory. You have a safety policy that says people on the widget production line need to do certain things to comply with safety regulations. New employees are briefed on this policy when they start, and it’s written down in a handbook everyone gets but no one ever reads. At the start of every week, you brief all the widget-line employees about what the production goals are for the week, and what the per-widget cash bonus is for every widget produced above the minimum. You told them once—maybe years ago—to be safe; you tell them every week what will get them a reward. If safety protocols and protective devices make it hard to exceed the minimum widget production rate, what do you think people are going to do?
