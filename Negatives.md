# NATTERING NABOBS OF NEGATIVITY

*Those that argue that a given security solution is flawed and therefore worthless tend to operate in research labs, and envision a techno utopia, vice the real world the rest of us live in. Even the best solutions have drawbacks and flaws. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use any of them, it means you have to compare the risks associated with using something less than perfect against no defense at all. You know: a business decision.*

Every solution I’ve discussed herein has a flaw. A drawback. A problem. Some of them are small and many are rare. Just as you hear about a new cybersecurity problem every week, you will also frequently hear about a problem with a cybersecurity solution. Contrary to what a lot of cybersecurity experts will tell you (the ones who love to talk about edge cases), just because a cybersecurity solution has a problem doesn’t make it useless. As with so many things, a lot depends on context, use-case, and the nature of the threat. Let’s take a look at some of the recommendations I’ve made and discuss issues people have raised with regards to their efficacy.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi- or two-factor authentication is most commonly carried out over your cellphone. But what if someone has compromised your phone? What if they’ve figured out how to clone your number or intercept the code before it gets to you?  Someone could log in as you, seem totally legit to the system, and you’d never know about it. Odds are pretty good that if that happened, depending on who the account is with and what kind of account it is, you’d be out of luck (that is to say: broke).

### Password Managers

As the final edits of this book were being made, a story broke about flaws found in common password managers, and the risks those flaws posed to those who used them.  Like clockwork, the edge-case crowd emerged to lambaste the companies that made the impacted password managers, and provide a dozen different recommendations about how to really address the password problem (most of which would be unusable in a real world situation). 

### Full Disk Encryption

FDE is not foolproof. If you don’t shut a system down properly and completely, FDE won’t protect anything. If your password is easy to guess, you might as well not have bothered encrypting anything.
