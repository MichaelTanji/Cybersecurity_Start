# MAKE BACKUPS AND CHECK THEM

*The quickest, easiest, and cheapest way to get back to business in the event of an attack, or any sort of disruption—manmade or otherwise—is to have current backups available. Back up your data regularly. Store copies of that data off-line, and if you’re particularly cautious, off-site. Backups are not a sexy or sophisticated security solution, but a standard, often mundane, task for a system administrator. Yet the value of a current backup can be, in the right circumstances, the sum total value of your business.*

Backups are one of those things, like checking a car’s fluid levels, which have the potential to save you a lot of grief and inconvenience. Backups allow you to quickly get back to business if a system crashes, your company gets carried away in a tornado, or if your systems fall prey to a ransomware infection.

Online backup services and most commercially available backup software take the guesswork out of backups, but it is still essential that you periodically check and make sure your data is actually there. If your IT person is using the backup utilities in an operating system, they absolutely must double check to make sure backed up data is there. I say this because here is a scenario I’ve seen play out more than once in my career: 

- System Administrator sets up a backup scheme.
- System Administrator doesn’t realize he misconfigured the backup scheme.
- System Administrator takes backup tapes or disks and stores them without verifying if the backups were actually made.
- In the aftermath of an attack or crash, System Administrator retrieves backup disks and tries to restore company data, only to find that the backup process ran, but because of the misconfiguration or some other error, no data was actually stored.
- System Administrator looks for deep hole to crawl into while they update their resume.

### Outsourcing Backups

If you want to let someone else do the heavy lifting when it comes to backing up data, look at services such as [Backblaze](www.backblaze.com) or [Carbonite](www.carbonite.com), which will back up data in near-real-time, leaving you time to focus on your business, not on becoming an expert in archiving. A note of caution: services like these require Internet connectivity to work. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to restore your system from backups but lack connectivity (e.g. after a hurricane when you’re running on generators, but Internet service hasn’t been restored), you could be out of luck until you can get back online.
