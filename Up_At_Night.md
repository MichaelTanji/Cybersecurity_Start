# WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT?

*It makes no sense to buy security tools or services without first figuring out not only what you are trying to protect, but also what you are trying to defend against. A little effort to answer those questions will help establish the goals of your cybersecurity program and clarify what needs to be done in order to achieve those goals. Absent some planning at the start, you will waste a lot of time, a lot of money, and develop a very hostile attitude towards cybersecurity that will work against you in the long run.*

Before we start talking about what sort of security policies, procedures, products, or services you need, I need you to get introspective for a minute and answer two questions for me:

- What do you have that is valuable to someone else?
- What, or who, are you worried about?

The answers to these questions are important because they set the stage for everything that comes next. There is no point in talking about solutions if you don’t know what needs protecting and whom you are protecting them against.

What we’re talking about here is a very basic approach to what’s called threat modeling. Threat modeling is a process for figuring out what you care about the most, and how to defend it against what you’re worried about the most. Put another way: what do you have that is of value, and how would someone who wants to take that from you do so?

Let’s take an example that is close to home. Literally. You’ve seen ads for keyless door locks, or maybe you’ve seen them at the hardware store. I’m talking about those door locks with the number keypads on them. Why carry a house key around when you can just punch a couple of numbers onto a keypad and voila! Stop making duplicate keys for all your kids, who are always losing them anyway, and so on. 

Now at this point, a hardcore security nerd will launch into a tirade about how insecure such locks are.  Most people are going to pick the minimum number combination or simplest pattern required, so it won’t take that long for a burglar to guess the code. If you look at the buttons some will be more worn than others, making guessing even easier, and so on. All valid points.

But what if you live in a neighborhood full of nosy people, where someone lingering in front of your front door repeatedly punching buttons would be noticed?  How concerned are you about someone manually working the combination now? What if you live out in the sticks and your neighbors are hundreds of yards or even miles away? Are you more concerned with someone guessing your key code, or slamming their size elevens violently against the door until it breaks open? 

The efficacy of any given mechanism (e.g. door lock for your house, firewall for your network) is not the sole decision point when considering how to protect something (the possessions in your house, the computer file with your secret recipe for fried chicken). Time, weather, people, the type of building, design features, non-security technology, and other factors all play a role. A weak lock on a wood door on a street with nosy neighbors can be just as effective a defense against a break-in as a strong lock on a steel door on a house in the exurbs. As you think about the things you need to secure your company, keep in mind that the solution everyone else is using may not be the right one for you.
