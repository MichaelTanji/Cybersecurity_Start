# WHO ARE YOU IN BED WITH?

*It is not enough that you take steps to protect your own enterprise, you have to make sure that everyone you do business with is of a like-mind. Hardening your relationships against threats is as important as hardening your computers and software. Not wanting to risk a ten-, twenty-, thirty-year relationship with “good old Tommy” is sentimental, not good sense. Ol’ Tommy isn’t going to pay to rebuild your business if he lets malware though to your systems or is the source of a breach.*

All the good work you do protecting your enterprise can come undone in a moment because of someone you trust. The trust relationships you have with suppliers, vendors, and customers (often referred to as a “supply chain”) are of great value to you, but they are a double-edged sword. You process their paperwork and requests almost without a thought because you’ve worked together for years, you know how each other operates and thinks, and you know they’re not going to pull a fast one on you. 

At least not intentionally.

If you’ve hardened your business against cyber threats and your partners have not, an attack on them makes it easier to attack you. You’re not as vigilant about checking emails from Alice for malicious intent because you’ve been doing business together for 25 years. She’d never phish your accountant and make off with $50,000 … but the guy who hacked Alice and is posing as her would. Remember the Target data breach from 2013? Target wasn’t hacked directly; they were compromised via an HVAC contractor.  

If you’re not thinking about your trust relationships, there is a very good chance that your biggest customers are, and it is going to manifest itself in new clauses in your next contract that require you to attest—if not prove—that you’ve taken steps to secure your enterprise to the standards they’ve decided on. It’s a good thing you are evaluating your trust relationships and can sign that agreement honestly and with confidence, because if you can’t, they’re not going to be your customer anymore. 

**The effort you put into improving your cybersecurity posture is a discriminator that makes you a more attractive supplier or vendor. Show your own suppliers and vendors that good security is good business, and if they want to do business with you, they need to step up their game, or they’re going to lose a customer. All of you are only as secure as the weakest one of you.**
